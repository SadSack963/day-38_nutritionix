Sheety
======
Sheet names act as API endpoints
    https://api.sheety.co/username/projectName/worksheet
Singular names such as “Event” will automatically be converted to the plural “Events”.
The sheet name will also be used as the root property in the returned JSON.
Sheety will return your data in the same format as it’s stored in your spreadsheet.

Making requests
---------------
base URL: https://api.sheety.co
endpoint: /username/projectName/sheetName

Getting rows
    GET https://api.sheety.co/username/projectName/sheetName will return all records in your sheet.
    If you want to return a specific record, append the object ID (which is just the row number) to the endpoint URL.
    Filtering rows
        Add query ?filter[property]=value
        stack multiple filters by joining them with a &

Add a row
    POST https://api.sheety.co/username/projectName/sheetName
    Set the "Content-Type" header to "application/json"
    with the data you want to add as a JSON payload in the request body.
    Sheety expects your record to be nested in a singular root property named after your sheet. For example if your endpoint is named emails, nest your record in a property called email.


Edit a row
    PUT https://api.sheety.co/username/projectName/sheetName/row
    with the changes you want to make as a JSON payload in the request body.

Delete a row
    DELETE https://api.sheety.co/username/projectName/sheetName/row

Authentication
--------------
By default Sheety has no authentication enabled on your API as this is usually suitable for most use cases (as long as the data isn’t sensitive!). Though any methods that edit your sheet (such as POST) are disabled by default.

Basic Auth
    With Basic Auth, a request contains a header field called Authorization, with the value set to the username and password encoded as base64. You set the username and password inside of Sheety.
    Sheety can generate the Authorization header value for you. Find it inside Authentication settings.
        {"Authorization": "Basic bnVsbDpudWxs"}

Bearer auth
    Bearer authentication works exactly the same as Basic auth, though instead of username and password encoded as base64, it’s simply a token (or secret) of your choosing.
